### Brief Contents

Part II is on editors vim and emacs, which I'll probably skip for now.

### Contents

This is a huge book... Chapter 1 looks like a very good orientation on where this all came from.

Ill probably also skip Chapter 9 on the TC Shell, and probably Chapter 11 on Perl.

### Preface

sobell.com has examples

very thorough explanation of contents chapter by chapter

this is going to be a great journey
